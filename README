git-iterative-blame is a custom Git command that makes tracing blame back in
time easier.

You provide a file and line (e.g. tests/example.py:110) and git-iterative-blame
will blame that file, show the commit and search for lines similar to the line
you provided. Then you can select one on which to recur or enter a new location,
and git-iterative-blame will blame the state of the file you chose just before
that commit and repeat the process. This provides a relatively easy way to find
when a line was introduced in the entire repository, even if it was moved
many times.

To use this, put git_iterative_blame.py on your PATH. If you rename it (or
symlink it) to git-iterative-blame, then it will be executable as a normal
Git command (e.g. `git iterative-blame file:line`)
